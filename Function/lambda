Lambdas, also known as anonymous functions or function literals, are a concise way to define small and simple functions in many programming languages. I'll explain various aspects of lambdas in Python, as it's a commonly used language for beginners.
____________________
Basic Lambda Syntax:

A lambda function is defined using the lambda keyword, followed by parameters and an expression.
Example:
lambda x: x * 2
This creates a function that takes one argument x and returns x * 2.
____________________
Assigning Lambdas to Variables:
You can assign a lambda function to a variable for later use.
Example:
double = lambda x: x * 2
Now, double(5) will return 10.
____________________
Using Lambdas as Arguments:
Lambdas are often used as arguments for functions that accept functions, like map(), filter(), and sorted().
Example:
numbers = [1, 4, 2, 7]
sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: x)
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: x)
This sorts the list in ascending order.

____________________
Filtering with Lambdas:
filter() can be used with a lambda to selectively include elements in a collection.
Example:
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
This filters out only the even numbers from the list.
____________________
Mapping with Lambdas:
map() applies a function to all items in an input list.

Example:
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x*2, numbers))
This squares each number in the list.
____________________
Lambda with Multiple Parameters:
Lambdas can take multiple parameters separated by commas.
Example:
add = lambda x, y: x + y
Now, add(3, 4) returns 7.
____________________
Using Lambdas in Key Functions:
Lambdas are handy for defining key functions in sorting.
Example:
words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
sorted_words = sorted(words, key=lambda x: len(x))
This sorts the words by their length.
____________________
Conditional Lambda:
You can use conditional expressions in lambdas for more complex logic.
Example:
is_even = lambda x: True if x % 2 == 0 else False
This lambda checks if a number is even.
____________________
Lambdas in GUI Programming:
Lambdas are often used in GUI programming for event handlers.
Example:
button = Button(text="Click me", command=lambda: print("Button clicked"))
____________________
Using Lambdas with reduce():
reduce() from the functools module can be used with lambdas to accumulate values.

Example:
from functools import reduce
sum_all = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)

This computes the sum of all elements in the list.
____________________
Higher-Order Functions:
Lambdas are commonly used with higher-order functions that accept functions as arguments or return functions.

Example:
def multiplier(n):
    return lambda x: x n
____________________
Closures:
Lambdas can capture variables from their surrounding scope, creating closures.

Example:
def outer_func(x):
    return lambda y: x + y
____________________
Recursion with Named Lambdas:
Although less common, you can define recursive functions using named lambdas.

Example:
factorial = (lambda f: lambda x: x * f(f, x - 1) if x > 0 else 1)(lambda f, x: x * f(f, x - 1) if x > 0 else 1)

if you want recursion with a named lambda you just, use the name of the function right in it:
Example:
f=lambda x:x*f(x-1) if x>0 else 1
