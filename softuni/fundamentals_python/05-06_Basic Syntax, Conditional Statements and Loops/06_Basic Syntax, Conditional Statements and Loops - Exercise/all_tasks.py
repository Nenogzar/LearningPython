3.	Chat Codes
Peter is a programming enthusiast who wants to create a chat where people will send messages via number codes. 
He starts by creating a program for only four messages. 
Create a program that receives the n number of messages sent. On the following n lines, it will receive integer numbers. 
For each number, the program should print a different message:
•	If the number is 88 - "Hello"
•	If the number is 86 - "How are you?"
•	If the number is not 88 nor 86, and it is below 88 - "GREAT!"
•	If the number is over 88 - "Bye."
