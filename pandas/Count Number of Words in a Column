Most data science professionals use the pandas library for data handling and preparation. The pandas library doesn’t have any method to count the number of words in a piece of text. One way to solve this problem is by finding the length of the text by splitting the complete text.

So let’s import a textual dataset where we can count the number of words in a column:

import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/articles.csv", encoding = 'latin1')
print(data.head())

The dataset has two columns Article and Title. Let’s create a new column as the number of words in the article column:

data["Number of Words"] = data["Article"].apply(lambda n: len(n.split()))
print(data.head())
